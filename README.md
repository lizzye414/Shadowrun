# Shadowrun

This is a personal project to create a windows forms application to help run a Shadowrun campaign. Shadowrun is a tabletop roleplaying game and managing the enemies within encounters can be difficult. This application aims to make the process easier. The project is created in C# using the entity framework on visual studio.
